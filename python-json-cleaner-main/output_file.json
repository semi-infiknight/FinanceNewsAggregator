            "content": "Leading exchanges, polled by the Russian press, have indicated they are not afraid of the upcoming strict crypto regulations. A requirement for coin trading platforms to establish a local office is one of the proposals in a regulatory roadmap drafted by the government in Moscow. Cryptocurrency Exchanges to Set Up Shop in Russian Federation Some of the world’s largest digital assets exchanges, interviewed by Kommersant, are not objecting to a potential requirement to establish permanent presence in Russia in order to continue to offer services to its citizens. The idea to oblige foreignbased platforms to do so is part of the government’s roadmap to regulate the country’s crypto space. The document, reportedly signed by Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko, has been prepared as an alternative approach to Bank of Russia’s call for a ban on trading, among other crypto operations. With its hardline stance, the central bank has found itself in isolation as most other government institutions, including the Finance Ministry, favor regulation over prohibition. Among other requirements envisaged in the roadmap are those related to antimoney laundering efforts such as the sharing of transaction data with Rosfinmonitoring, Russia’s financial watchdog. Crypto market players will also have to put in place mechanisms to verify information about the ownership of the digital assets they are dealing with. Binance, the largest crypto exchange by volume, told the business daily it’s ready to open a branch or even register a legal entity in Russia, “if this contributes to the convenience of users and the security of operations.” Olga Goncharova, head of government relations for Russia and the CIS countries, said that Binance supports the regulatory roadmap as a step that “will make operations more understandable, transparent, and userfriendly” while also noting the proposals need further “calibration.” Another major crypto trading platform, Huobi, stated that it hopes for an “open dialogue with Russian regulators.” Its team believes that a constructive cryptocurrency law would help increase confidence in digital assets and exchanges in both individual and institutional investors. Crypto exchange AAX revealed it has no immediate plans to establish an office in the Russian Federation but it also said it may start working in this direction in case the regulations are approved. AAX is ready to comply with what it described as “legitimate” regulatory requirements. The exchange, which serves around half a million Russian residents, remarked that it keeps information about its clients, their balances, transactions, and trading activities. Russian lawmakers are now working on a new bill to fill the regulatory gaps remaining after the adoption of the law “On Digital Financial Assets.” The authors aim to define which entities will be allowed to work with cryptocurrencies, including crypto exchanges. Trading platforms incorporated abroad will be subject to a “special” registration regime, the Deputy Chair of the Security and AntiCorruption Committee Andrey Lugovoy, one of the sponsors, told Russian media.

            "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) en de rest van de cryptocurrencymarkt kregen gisteren weer een klap te verduren. Het marktsentiment begon de laatste tijd steeds meer bullish te worden, maar draait nu toch weer richting bearish om. Ondertussen ligt het handelsvolume nog steeds zeer laag, mede dankzij dat Azië het nieuwe jaar deze week viert. De angst neemt volgens de Fear & Greed Index weer toe: Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index is 20 ~ Extreme FearCurrent price: $36,974 pic.twitter.com/93LZUuSaPk — Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index (@BitcoinFear) February 3, 2022 Bitcoin koers zakt 3,5% Gisterenochtend duwde bitcoin nog tegen weerstand rond $39.000 aan terwijl de koers boven $38.500 standhield. Gisterenmiddag verloor de bitcoin koers echter grip op deze $38.500 en kelderde naar $37.500. Daarmee leek de koers in eerste instantie wellicht een higher low te vestigen ten opzichte van de dip naar $37.000 op maandag. Bitcoin begon dan ook weer te stijgen, maar enkele uren later verloor de koers wederom grip en kelderde toen naar $37.000 op Binance en €32.775 op Bitvavo. Toch hield bitcoin hier gedurende nacht stand. UPDATE: Kort na publicatie verliest bitcoin toch grip op de $37.000 en de koers daalt momenteel richting $36.500. Daling gaat gepaard met twee zaken De dip van de bitcoin koers gaat gepaard met aandelen van grote technologie bedrijven die allemaal diep in de min staan. Meta (Facebook), Spotify, SnapChat, Netflix, Paypal en meer kregen gisteren allemaal een zware klap, soms wel meer dan 20%. Opvallend is dat de koersen van aandeelmarkten als S&P500 en en Nasdaq gisteren nog wel stegen waardoor de correlatie met bitcoin, die zeer hoog ligt, iets afneemt. De tweede dip van de bitcoin koers ging gisteren gepaard samen met een aanval op Wormhole, een zogenaamde crosschain bridge tussen Ethereum (ETH) en Solana. Maar liefst $320 miljoen aan ETH werd gestolen door een hacker en vooral de SOL koers daalt daardoor hard. Hoe ver kan koers weer zakken? Volgens Whale Map is het volgende supportniveau al te vinden rond $36.650$36.850. Daar kochten de whales namelijk veel BTC in: #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/TDKPbwjEBS — whalemap (@whale_map) February 2, 2022 Mocht bitcoin hierdoorheen zakken, dan vinden we wellicht support rond $34.000$35.000. Echter verwachten meerdere analisten dat we wellicht nog een hertest zullen zien van de recente low van $33.000, of wellicht zelfs van de $29.000$30.000 als afgelopen zomer. #BTC I don't like longterm predictions, but I think we may visit the 30k/33k zone.

Additionally, losses from crypto sales could not be offset against other income, potentially discouraging trading and investment in digital assets.

India’s federal budget placed earnings from cryptocurrencies and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) in India’s highest tax band. (Credits: Getty) The Indian government was known for draconian measures against crypto and even banning it at one point. So, the regulation is a welcome change for the Indian crypto community. However, the idea of paying more than 30% of their crypto profits in tax and other charges will not appeal to new investors. India’s central bank has previously voiced ‘serious concerns’ around private cryptocurrencies on the grounds that these could cause financial instability. As a result, several banks severed ties with crypto firms. In a Uturn from that stance, India’s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman said that the central bank will introduce a digital currency in the next financial year using blockchain and other supporting technology. ‘The introduction of a central bank digital currency will give a big boost to the digital economy. Digital currency will also lead to a more efficient and cheaper currency management system,’ said Sitharaman. India’s Finance Secretary later confirmed that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum will ‘never become legal tender’ i.e be used for payments. Users can instead use the digital rupee issued by the central bank to purchase nondigital assets. Industry estimates suggest there are 15 million to 20 million crypto investors in India, with total crypto holdings of around 400 billion rupees (£3.96 billion). No official data is available on the size of the Indian crypto market.

In a Uturn from that stance, India’s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman said that the central bank will introduce a digital currency in the next financial year using blockchain and other supporting technology. ‘The introduction of a central bank digital currency will give a big boost to the digital economy. Digital currency will also lead to a more efficient and cheaper currency management system,’ said Sitharaman. India’s Finance Secretary later confirmed that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum will ‘never become legal tender’ i.e be used for payments . Users can instead use the digital rupee issued by the central bank to purchase nondigital assets. Industry estimates suggest there are 15 million to 20 million crypto investors in India, with total crypto holdings of around 400 billion rupees (£3.96 billion). No official data is available on the size of the Indian crypto market.

Toch kleeft er ook een schaduwzijde aan de NFTmarkt. Polygon NFTgebruikers op OpenSea stijgt Te beginnen met het goede nieuws. Het aantal actieve gebruikers op OpenSea van op Polygon (MATIC) gebaseerde NFT’s is namelijk gestegen. In december 2021 waren er nog zo’n 176.000 gebruikers, in januari 2022 steeg dit aantal naar 218.000. Ook het aantal Polygon NFT’s die verkocht zijn is gestegen. 1/ @0xPolygon's NFT activity on @opensea  in the past month has been phenomenal, with global brands consistently dropping their collections. Volume: $78.9 MnAvg. trades/ day: 102kEstimated monthly savings: $195.6 MnAvg. cost/ txn: $0.04 pic.twitter.com/MHoa7Zlwid — Simran Gogia (@Simran__02) February 2, 2022 In de laatste maand van 2021 gingen er nog 1,99 miljoen Polygon NFT’s over de toonbank bij OpenSea. Een maand later steeg dit aantal naar 2,68 miljoen. De gemiddelde waarde per gebruiker ging echter wel omlaag van $432 naar $360. Dit lijkt echter vooral te wijten aan de marktbrede crash waardoor veel cryptocurrencies minder waard werden. De data laat zien dat de NFTgekte nog altijd aanhoudt en zelfs toe blijft nemen. Veel grote merken stappen de virtuele wereld in en lanceren collecties van digitale NFT’s. Door de unieke aard van een NFT zijn de tokens een interessant middel geworden voor de marketing van deze merken. Bovendien levert het natuurlijk ook een extra inkomstenbron op. Enkele bekende merken die NFTcollecties hebben gelanceerd zijn Nike, Lamborghini en Ubisoft. NFT wash trading en witwaspraktijken De ontwikkelingen zijn echter niet allemaal positief. Onchain analysebedrijf Chainalysis geeft namelijk in een nieuw rapport aan dat zij duidelijke signalen zien van wash trading en witwaspraktijken. Wash trading is het verkopen en tegelijk kopen van dezelfde NFT door dezelfde persoon. De persoon kan bijvoorbeeld zijn eigen NFT voor miljoenen euro’s verkopen aan zichzelf. Door de transactiegeschiedenis lijkt het nu alsof deze NFT een significante waarde heeft. “We hebben 262 gebruikers geïdentificeerd die meer dan 25 keer een NFT hebben verkocht aan een zelfgefinancierd adres,” stelt Chainalysis. 110 gebruikers zouden hiermee $8,9 miljoen hebben verdiend. Ook witwaspraktijken zijn reden tot zorgen vindt het bedrijf. In 2021 zouden deze praktijken weer zijn toegenomen. Dit kan de verdere ontwikkeling van de markt beschadigen: “Het witwassen van geld, en in het bijzonder overdrachten van gesanctioneerde cryptocurrencybedrijven, vormt een groot risico voor het opbouwen van vertrouwen in NFT’s, en moet nauwer worden gecontroleerd door marktplaatsen, regelgevers en wetshandhavers,”",

            "content": "ShutterstockNews emerged overnight of the potential theft of more than US$326 million of Ethereum tokens from a blockchain bridge (which connects two blockchains so cryptocurrency can be exchanged between them). It’s no surprise. Crypto crime has been on the rise – especially since the pandemic began. How are these crimes committed? And what can you do to stay ahead of scammers? Direct theft vs scams There are two main ways criminals obtain cryptocurrency: stealing it directly, or using a scheme to trick people into handing it over. In 2021, crypto criminals directly stole a record US$3.2 billion (A$4.48 billion) worth of cryptocurrency, according to Chainalysis. That’s a fivefold increase from 2020. But schemes continue to overshadow outright theft, enabling scammers to lure US$7.8 billion worth of cryptocurrency from unsuspecting victims. Crypto crime is a fastgrowing enterprise. The rise of the crypto economy and decentralised finance (or DeFi), coupled with record cryptocurrency prices in 2021, has provided criminals with lucrative opportunities. Australian data confirm the global trends. The Australian Consumer and Competition Commission reported more than A$26 million was lost to scams involving cryptocurrency in 2020 from 1,985 reports. In December, federal police told the ABC crypto scam losses for 2021 exceeded A$100 million. That’s despite many incidents likely left unreported, often due to embarrassment by victims. Theft from exchanges Most consumers obtain cryptocurrency from an exchange. This involves opening an account and depositing currency, such as Australian dollars, before converting it to a chosen cryptocurrency. Typically the cryptocurrency is held in a “custodial wallet”. That means it’s assigned to the consumer’s account, but the private keys that control the cryptocurrency are held by the exchange. In other words, the exchange stores the cryptocurrency on the consumer’s behalf. But just as a bank doesn’t hold all of its deposits in cash, an exchange will only hold enough cryptocurrency in “hot” wallets (connected to the internet) to facilitate customer transactions. For security, the remainder is held in “cold” wallets (not connected to the internet). Unlike a bank, however, the government does not have a financial claims scheme to guarantee cryptocurrency deposits if the exchange goes bust. The recent BitMart hack is a cautionary tale. On December 4, the exchange announced it had “identified a largescale security breach” resulting in the theft of about US$150 million pls put AUD in brackets after any foreign dollar amount in crypto assets from hot wallets. BitMart temporarily suspended withdrawals and later promised it would use its “own funding to cover the incident and compensate affected users”. It’s unclear when this will happen, with the CNBC reporting in January that customers were still unable to access their cryptocurrency. BitMart wasn’t the first exchange to be hacked, and it won’t be the last. Similarly, consumers may be left with losses if an exchange fails for commercial reasons, rather than theft. Australians were left stranded in December when liquidators were appointed over Melbournebased exchange myCryptoWallet. One way consumers can protect themselves from exchange theft, or insolvency, is to transfer their cryptocurrency from the exchange to a software wallet (a secure application installed on a computer or smartphone) or a hardware wallet (a hardware device that can be disconnected from the computer and internet). The cryptocurrency will then be under your direct control. But be warned, if you lose your private keys, you lose your cryptocurrency. Read more: The metaverse is money and crypto is king – why you'll be on a blockchain when you're virtualworld hopping Types of scams Drawing on the ACCC’s latest edition of the Little Black Book of Scams, the following types of scam are commonly observed in the cryptocurrency space, where the scammer is not personally known to the target: Email phishing The scammer sends unsolicited emails asking for personal login details, which can be used to steal cryptocurrency. Alternatively, they may offer “prizes” or “rewards” in exchange for a deposit. Investment scams The scammer creates a website that resembles a legitimate investment trading platform. It may be a fraudulent copy of a real business, or a completely bogus one. They may even post fake advertisements on social media platforms, with fake celebrity endorsements. In the latest news, billionaire mining magnate Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest has launched criminal proceedings against Meta (previously Facebook) for allowing scam ads using his image. More sophisticated operations will have multiple scammers emailing and calling victims to give the impression of being a legitimate organisation. After cryptocurrency deposits are made, victims may be able to “trade” on the fake platform but can’t withdraw their supposed earnings. Delay tactics include asking for further deposits to be made for fees or taxes. Romance scams The scammer creates a fake profile and matches with victims on a dating app or website. They may then ask for funds to help them with a personal crisis, such as needing a surgery. Or they may say they’re trading cryptocurrency and encourage the target to get involved, leading the victim into an investment scam, as described above. If a victim doesn’t already have a cryptocurrency exchange account, scammers may also coach them on how to open one. Some will mislead victims into installing remote access software on their computer, granting the scammer direct access to their internet banking or exchange account. Practical challenges There are practical legal challenges in the crypto crime environment. While reporting scams can be helpful in providing data and intelligence for regulators and law enforcement, it’s unlikely to result in the recovery of funds. Taking civil legal action may be possible, too, but identifying perpetrators is difficult. Since cryptocurrency is by its very nature global and decentralised, payments are often made to parties outside of Australia. So prevention is easier than a cure. The main way to avoid being scammed is to ensure you know exactly who you’re dealing with, transact through a reputable exchange and ensure all the channels you go through are verified. If an offer sounds too good to be true, it almost certainly is. Regulation on the horizon In Australia, cryptocurrency exchanges must be registered with AUSTRAC, in compliance with antimoney laundering and counterterror financing obligations. But there are currently no other licensing requirements (such as capital requirements or cybersecurity, for example). Last year, the Senate Select Committee into Australia as a Technology and Financial Centre recommended a more comprehensive licensing framework. The Australian government agreed with the recommendation, and the federal treasury department is due to begin consulting on what this will look like. Mandatory measures to curb cryptocurrency crime at the exchange level will likely be high on the agenda. Aaron M.
